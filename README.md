# Project Description
NCSU ECE-558 (Digital Imaging Systems) Project 1
- Instructor: Prof. Tianfu Wu
  - Implement the aspects of affine 3D geometry of an object what has a single perspective and generate a 3d reconstruction of the object.
  
## Dependencies
  - numpy
  - OpenCV
  - Scipy.linalg
  
## About
- ak_codes has the code file which has comments for reference. The input image has and an object whose coordinates of the edges were calculated manually using paint.

## Future Targets 
- Implementing a GUI extension instead of manulaly caluclating the coordinates of the vanishing points.
- planning on using LSD to compute the line segment, and then compute 
the vanishing points based on RANSAC.

## Notes
- Used Blender for reconstruction so make sure to have Blender installed.
- Can also be done using VRML.
